<article>
<p>This is a very short, not so very sweet (or accurate, really) summary of the Mythology of The X-Files, a section of the FBI dedicated to investigating the paranormal and extraterrestrial.  Of course, accuracy is entirely subjective, especially in the eyes of the writers of The X-Files.  It's also moot since I'm well aware this is 2013, but play along anyway.
